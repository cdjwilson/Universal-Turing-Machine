# Universal-Turing-Machine
Part of a school project to create a universal turing machine that can accept other turning machines and run them on a given input.
works for most input turning machines, does not work for turing machines that write past the blank spaces at the end.
The Jake TM in ExampleTM's is the universal turing machine written by me, some stuff in TM and UniversalTM was written by me.
All the other essential stuff to make TM's run was written by my professor.
To run the universal TM you give it a TM and an input which you encode and you check if it accepts, an example to this is in ExampleTM's.
